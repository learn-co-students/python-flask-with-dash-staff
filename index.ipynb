    "In this lab we are going to practice working with creating a RESTful web app that returns HTML about Tweets and Users. In this domain Users will have many Tweets and Tweets will, therefore, belong to a User. We already have our app's database and RESTful routes set up to return information about our resources. We are going to build on what we already have to add in some templates and focus on creating some views with HTML for our users and tweets. Let's get started!"
